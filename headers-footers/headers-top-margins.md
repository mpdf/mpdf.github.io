(mPDF >= 4.0)

In standard usage, mPDF sets the following:

- top-margin = distance in mm from top of page to start of text (ignoring any headers)
- header-margin = distance in mm from top of page to start of header
- bottom-margin = distance in mm from bottom of page to bottom of text (ignoring any footers)
- footer-margin = distance in mm from bottom of page to bottom of footer

If you specify a header that extends further down the page than the top-margin, then the header and main text will overlap.

# Alternative margin usage

The configuration variables <a href="{{ "/reference/mpdf-variables/setautotopmargin.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">`$setAutoTopMargin`</a> 
and <a href="{{ "/reference/mpdf-variables/setautotopmargin.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">`$setAutoBottomMargin`</a> can be set. Both default to <span class="smallblock">FALSE</span>.

## pad

If `$setAutoTopMargin` is set to **`'pad'`** then the value for margin-top is used to set a fixed distance in mm 
(padding) between the bottom of the header and top of the main text. The converse is true with `$setAutoBottomMargin`.

## stretch

If `$setAutoTopMargin` is set to **`'stretch'`** then the margin-top sets a **minimum** 
distance in mm between the top of the page and the top of the main text, which expands if header is too large to fit. 

The configuration variable <a href="{{ "/reference/mpdf-variables/automarginpadding.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">`$autoMarginPadding`</a>
(default: `2`, configurable) defines an additional distance in mm used as padding between the header and main text. This is the behaviour seen 
in Microsoft Word.

The converse is true with `$setAutoBottomMargin`.

# Experimental!

Use of this function is probably best considered experimental. It is incompatible with some of the other 
functionality in mPDF, and has some limitations:

- Using either pad or stretch, the values are set for the whole document - changes during the document will 
  produce unpredictable results
- Incompatible with orientation changes, 
  <a href="{{ "/reference/mpdf-variables/forceportraitheaders.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">`$forceportraitheaders`</a> 
  or <a href="{{ "/reference/mpdf-variables/forceportraitmargins.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">`$forceportraitmargins`</a>
- Does not work with "write to current page" options for Headers
- Incompatible with CSS <a href="{{ "/paging/using-page.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">@page</a>d media
- Cannot set a new Footer when already further down the page than there is room needed for footer
- Potential error if using `{nbpg}` to define page total in an HTML header or footer. The top/bottom margin is 
  calculated by writing the HTML header using the current page no. If when the header is finally written, 
  a page number total of e.g. 500 causes an extra line in the header/footer, this will not be allowed for.
