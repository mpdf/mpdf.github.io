mPDF requires a minimum of PHP 4.3.10 or PHP 5.0.3

mPDF v5.7.1 minimum is required for PHP >= 5.5

(Since version 1, mPDF has been developed on PHP5 only, but should still be compatible with PHP >= 4.3.10)   

PHP requires the `mb_string` module to be enabled (including `mbregex`, which needs to be explicitly enabled in some environments)

mPDF is **not** compatible with PHP function overloading (`mbstring.func_overload`)

As for FPDF, PHP requires `zlib` for compression.

Improved performance requires write permissions to the temporary cache folders.
