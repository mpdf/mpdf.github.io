mPDF 7.0 requires PHP 5.6, 7.0.0 or 7.1.0. PHP `mbstring` (including `mbregex`, which needs to
be explicitly enabled in some environments) and `gd` extensions have to be loaded.

Additional extensions may be required for some advanced features such as `zlib` for compression of embedded
resources such as fonts or `bcmath` for generating barcodes or `xml` for character set conversion
and SVG handling.

mPDF is **not** compatible with PHP function overloading (`mbstring.func_overload`)

As for importing existing PDF files with FPDI, PHP requires `zlib` for compression.

For requirements of versions < 7.x see [dedicated page](https://mpdf.github.io/about-mpdf/requirements-v5.html)
