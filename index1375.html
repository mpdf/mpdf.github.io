<h5>Justifying text &amp; Spacing</h5> 
<h6>Character and Word spacing</h6> 
<p>When text-alignment is set to Justify (i.e. aligning to both right and left margins), word spacing and character spacing are normally used to justify text.</p> 
<p>The PDF file definition does not enable word-spacing when using multibyte encoding e.g. Unicode fonts or CJK languages. However, mPDF creates word-spacing in these formats by altering the character spacing for the spaces between words.</p> 
<p>Thus both character and word spacing can be used in all modes, including Unicode and CJK.</p> 
<p>The default is to use a mix of character and word spacing. The ratio is set by variables defined at the top of the mpdf.php file:</p> 
<p class="examplecode">var $jSpacing = ''; // Spacing method when Justifying [ C, W or blank (for mixed e.g. 40/60) ]<br /> 
var $jSWord = 0.4;&nbsp; // Percentage(/100) of spacing to allocate to Word vs. Character<br /> 
var $jSmaxChar = 2; // Maximum spacing to allocate to character spacing. (0 = no maximum)</p> 
<p>The maximum (<span class="parameter">$jSmaxChar</span>) will prevent excessive, ugly and difficult-to-read character spacing.</p> 
<p>CJK characters usually need to be character-spaced (as each character is like a word), and cursive scripts like Arabic need to be word-spaced. These are predefined in htmltoolkit.php, which sets <span class="parameter">jSpacing</span> to C or W which overrides the default, and is determined by the language/country code (en-GB).</p> 
<h6>"Orphans"</h6> 
<p>HTML2FPDF used spaces to determine where to cut lines, but assumes that the end of a block of text within tags is a suitable place to wrap the line. This not always the case e.g.:<br /> 
... the end of a sentence ends in &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;.<br /> 
... the end of a sentence ends with a reference&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;</p> 
<p>mPDF will prevent these "orphans" (. in first case and <sup>32</sup> in second) being moved to a next line and separated from the preceding text. This works for .,:;?!’”)›‚»„ and sup and sub text. The maximum number of characters is set at the top of the mpdf.php file as var <span class="parameter">$orphansAllowed</span> (default value 5 e.g <sup>34-36</sup>).</p> 
<h6>Non-breaking space (NBSP)</h6> 
<p>The non-breaking space character is supported when using all codepages other than CJK - unless the font chosen does not have a glyph/character representing the nbsp (? only FreeSerif); in these cases the nbsp is converted to a normal space. When supported, it prevents word wrapping and prevents collapse of white space as expected with HTML.</p> 
<h6>The last line (mPDF &gt;= 4.0)</h6> 
<p>The last line of justified text is left-aligned, but when the penultimate line has been stretched to fit the page width it appears best if the last line also has increased spacing . This was introduced in mPDF 4.0.</p> 
<p>If the penultimate line was stretched considerably, the last line may look odd using the same spacing, so maximum values for the character-spacing (<span class="parameter">$jSmaxCharLast</span>) and word-spacing (<span class="parameter">$jSmaxWordLast</span>) can be set in the configuration file.</p> 
<h6>Justification before line-breaks</h6> 
<p>In a justified text block, an inline &lt;img&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, or &lt;select&gt; element which causes a new line, force the previous line to be justified. However, a &lt;hr&gt; or &lt;br&gt; do not force justification of the preceeding text.</p> 
<p>This behaviour matches most browsers. To allow optional compliance with the bahaviour of MS Word, which also justifies text before a &lt;br&gt; you can set the configurable variable <a href="http://mpdf1.com/manual/index.php?tid=441">justifyB4br</a> to true.</p>
