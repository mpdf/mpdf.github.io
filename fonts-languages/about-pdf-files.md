In order for users to be able to read a PDF file, they need to be able to access the necessary fonts/characters. 
They can do this in three ways:

- PDF files have certain standard fonts: Arial/Helvetica, Times and Courier in the win-1252 character set, and 
  Zapfdingbats and Symbol character sets. These fonts should be available to any PDF reading program, and do not 
  need to be embedded in the PDF document.
- Files using CJK (chinese-japanese-korean) characters can refer to standard fonts which are freely downloadable from 
  the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrrasianfontpack.html" target="_blank">Adobe website</a>. 
  Users will need to download these font-packs to read the document. The four Asian fonts provided by Adobe 
  contain all the characters in codepages: SHIFT_JIS, UHC (cp949), GBK, or BIG5.
- Font information can be embedded in the file. It is possible to embed a subset of the font information selectively 
  for only the characters used in the document, or the whole font file.
