(mPDF >= 2.3)

Using the class extension (mPDFI), an existing PDF file can be overwritten, replacing specified text with alternatives.
For example you may have created a long complex PDF file, and you wish to produce copies with an individual number on
each copy without having to re-generate the whole document each time.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
  **Note:** `OverWrite()` was written to work on PDF files produced
  by mPDF. It will work with encrypted files, as long as the same encryption properties are used for the new document.
  I have also used it successfully with a number of external PDF files, including those produced by Acrobat Distiller
  (but not if they are encrypted). It will not work with embedded font subsets.
</div>
