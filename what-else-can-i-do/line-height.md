The line-height of text can be controlled using the CSS property `line-height` (since mPDF 4). This used a fixed value 
for the line-height when `normal` was specified (the default CSS value) -Â  set by the configurable variable 
`normalLineheight`. It also used a fixed proportion to determine the position of the text baseline (non-configurable).

Form mPDF 6, you can (optionally) use font metrics derived from each font file to:

- Determine the height of a line when `line-height` is set to `normal`
- Determine the glyph baseline (previously a fixed value)

Options are set by 
<a href="{{ "/configuration/configuration-v7-x.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">configuration variables</a>.

Default settings in mPDF versions >= 6.0 - recommended especially for complex scripts with marks used 
above or below characters:

```php
<?php

$mpdf->useFixedNormalLineHeight = false;
$mpdf->useFixedTextBaseline = false;
$mpdf->adjustFontDescLineheight = 1.14;

```

Settings to be backwards compatible with mPDF versions < 6:

```php
<?php

$this->useFixedNormalLineHeight = true;
$this->useFixedTextBaseline = true;
$this->normalLineheight = 1.33;

```

Using the font metrics will give approximately the same result as the fixed value for many standard Latin script 
fonts e.g. DejaVu Sans Condensed:

However, for some fonts the normal line-height using font metrics will be significantly taller, to account for the 
design of the font glyphs e.g. Khmer font:

# CSS control of line-height

From mPDF v 6.0 there are new controls for line-height using draft CSS3 properties. These can be set on all block level 
elements (P, DIV etc) and tables (TABLE/TD/TH).

```css
line-stacking-strategy: inline-line-height|block-line-height|max-height|grid-height
```

Values:
* `inline-line-height` - [default] lineheight is initially calculated from the block-level `font[-size]`; the height is 
   expanded by any inline content, including the calculated lineheight of that inline content;
* `block-line-height` - lineheight is fixed as the lineheight of the block-level `font[-size]`;
* `max-height` - lineheight is initially calculated from the block-level font; the height is expanded by any inline 
  content, EXCLUDING the calculated lineheight of that inline content;
* `grid-height` - lineheight is initially calculated from the block-level font; the height is expanded - **as 
  multiples of initial lineheight** - by any inline content, EXCLUDING the calculated lineheight of that inline content;

Note: XSL has a similar property with the same name, which uses different but equivalent values: `line-height` 
instead of `inline-line-height`, `font-height` instead of `block-line-height`. It also uses `max-height`. The value 
`grid-height` is new to the CSS3 property.

```css
line-stacking-shift: consider-shifts|disregard-shifts
```

This property determines whether to include or disregard the adjusted top- and bottom-edge of any characters that 
have a baseline-shift (e.g. superscript) when calculating lineheight.

Note: XSL has a similar property with a different name: `line-height-shift-adjustment` which uses the same values.

# Note for Advanced users

There are actually three possible metrics that can be used in a TrueType font file. The differences are summed up 
quite well in this article at <a href="http://typophile.com/node/13081">http://typophile.com/node/13081</a>. 
mPDF will by default use the usWinAscent and usWinDescent values to determine a 'normal' line-height, with two variations:

- if either the usWinAscent or usWinDescent are greater than the font bounding box (yMin yMax), then the values are 
  reduced to equal the yMin/yMax values. NB this works as a fix with Myanmar Text (Windows 8 version) to give a 
  line-height normal that is equivalent to that produced in browsers.
- if the USE_TYPO_METRICS bit is set on fsSelection (OS/2 table), this is telling the font to use the sTypo values and 
  not the usWinAscent values. NB this works as a fix with Cambria Math font to give a normal line-height; at present, 
  this is the only font I have found with this bit set; although note that MS WordPad and Windows FireFox browser use 
  the big line-height from usWinAscent, whilst MS Word 2007 observes the fSelection value.

You can change the font metrics used by mPDF, by setting `fontDescriptor` 
<a href="{{ "/configuration/configuration-v7-x.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">configuration variable</a>

- `winTypo` uses sTypoAscender etc from the OS/2 table and is the one officially recommended - BUT
- `win` use usWinAscent etc from OS/2 and in practice seems to be used most commonly in Windows environment; 
  this is the default in mPDF;
- `mac` uses Ascender etc from hhea table, and may be used to give results consistent with a Mac/OSX environment.

Finally, you can override values for Ascent, Descent and Leading for any specific font, by setting 
font <a href="{{ "/configuration/configuration-v7-x.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">configuration variables</a>.

```php
<?php
"cambriamath" => array(
    'R' => "cambria.ttc",
    'useOTL' => 0xFF,
    'TTCfontID' => array( 'R' => 2, ),
    'Ascent' => 950,
    'Descent' => -222,
    'Leading' => 0,
),

```

Note - The same values are used for all styles of the font-family. Descent values should be negative. All 
values should be given using a 1000 units per em scale, regardless of the UnitsPerEm used in the font design.

# Notes

Remember that line-height for a TABLE has a default value (`1.2`) set in the `defaultCSS`. 
<a href="{{ "/configuration/configuration-v7-x.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">configuration variable</a>.
This is left in for backwards compatability. You can change this value to 'normal' for results consistent with most browsers.

Line-height in a `<textarea>` is fixed and defined in `\Mpdf\Form` class (= `1.2`)

Details of the font metrics can be seen by inspecting the temporary font files e.g. `/ttfontdata/[fontname].mtx.php`.
