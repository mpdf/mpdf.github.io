(mPDF >= 5.7)

CSS "z-index" can be used to utilise layers in the PDF document.

CSS can set the z-index for any block element or image (default = 0). This does not work on block elements 
with fixed or absolute position.

## Set the Initial state for each layer

You can set initial state="hidden" for a specific z-index (z), and/or specify a display name for the Layer e.g.

```php
<?php

$mpdf->layerDetails[z]['state']='hidden';    // Set initial state of layer - "hidden" or nothing

```

```php
<?php

$mpdf->layerDetails[z]['name']='Correct Answers';

```

- where z= the z-index (set by CSS)

Note:

- Using layers automatically changes the resulting PDF document to PDF 1.5 version (which is incompatible with PDFA and PDFX in mPDF).
- You cannot nest layers - inner values will be ignored

## Display the Layers pane in PDF document viewer

`$mpdf->open_layer_pane` (set by default as `'open_layer_pane' => false` as a 
<a href="{{ "/configuration/configuration-v7-x.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">configuration variable</a>) 
can be set to open the layers pane in the browser when the document is opened.

```php
<?php

$mpdf->open_layer_pane = true;

```

## Set Programatically

If you are writing the PDF document using functions other than WriteHTML(), you can set the layers as follows:

```php
<?php

$mpdf->BeginLayer($z-index);

...

$mpdf->EndLayer();

```

## Reserved Layer Names

mPDF automatically adds layer names for visibility: "Print only", "Screen only", and "Hidden"; these only show when utilised.
