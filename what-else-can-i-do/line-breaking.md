The algorithm for determining automatic line breaks was completely rewritten in mPDF v6.0 - the 
following notes apply to mPDF >= 6.0

Line breaks will be allowed at:

- Spaces U+0020
- Word break U+200B
- Hyphen-minus U+002D when CSS `hyphens` set to `manual` or `auto`, except when in a URL, or when following 
  character is a `>` or a numeral
- Hard hyphen U+2010 when CSS `hyphens` set to `manual` or `auto`
- Soft hyphen U+00AD "Â­" when CSS `hyphens` set to `manual` or `auto`
- <a href="{{ "/what-else-can-i-do/hyphenation.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Automatic hyphenation</a> 
  when CSS `hyphens` set to `auto`
- Between CJK characters, except CJK numerals, before "CJK-following" or after "CJK-leading" characters

Lao, Thai and Khmer text does not have space between words. By default, mPDF uses word dictionaries to determine 
appropriate opportunities for line-breaks. Users may turn this function off using the configurable 
variable `useDictionaryLBR`.

Alternatively users can insert the character U+200B (zero-width space) in the text to mark line-breaking opportunities 
manually.

Similarly for Tibetan script, mPDF 6 uses a simple algorithm to identify line-breaking opportunities after the 
characters U+0F0B (Tsheg) or U+0F0D. This can be overridden using the configurable variable `useTibetanLBR`.
