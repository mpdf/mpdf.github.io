SetAnchor2Bookmark â€“ Specifies whether PDF Bookmarks are created automatically from HTML anchors

# Description

void **SetAnchor2Bookmark** ( int <span class="parameter">$mode</span> )

Specifies whether PDF Book marks are created from HTML anchors (e.g. `<a name="Introduction" />`) .

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
  **Note:** This function/method was altered in mPDF 2.2 by capitalising the first letter of the name. 
  As function/method names in PHP have hitherto been case-insensitive, this should not cause any problems, but it is 
  recommended where possible to use the preferred spelling.
</div>

# Parameters

<span class="parameter">$mode</span>

: Set the variable with one of the values.
  
  **Values**

  * `0` - does not generate a bookmark
  * `1` - generate a bookmark using the text value of the `name="Text"` attribute
  
  Default: `0`

  <td markdown="1">
  `$mode = 2` removed

# Examples

Example #1

```php
<?php
$mpdf = new \Mpdf\Mpdf();
$mpdf->SetAnchor2Bookmark(1);

$mpdf->WriteHTML('<h1><a name="Section 1" />The title</h1>');

$mpdf->Output();

```

This will create a Bookmark in the PDF document: "Section 1"

# Notes

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
  **Note:** Prior to mPDF 3.0 you could specify `$mode = 2` which added 
  the page number to the bookmark e.g. "Introduction (p.32)". This was removed as it did not accurately handle
  pagebreaks etc.
</div>
