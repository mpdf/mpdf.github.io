(mPDF >= 2.3 & < 6.0)

autoFontGroupSize – Specify the chunk size of text to group when auto-detecting languages using SetAutoFont()

# Value

void **autoFontGroupSize**

Specify the chunk size of text to group when auto-detecting languages using
<a href="{{ "/reference/mpdf-functions/setautofont.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">SetAutoFont()</a>.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" markdown="1">
  **Note:** This variable is removed from mPDF v 6.0
</div>

Bigger chunks (`3`) allows reversal of whole sentences of RTL text, not just letters in individual words; the disadvantage
is that it may include bits of other languages either side, forcing them in the font used for the "foreign" language.

Smaller chunks (`1`) - analysing word by word - takes more processing time, and cannot reverse RTL sentences. In text with
CJK language, it makes it harder for mPDF to correctly identify between e.g. Korean and Chinese which share some
characters. Thus words may be identified alternately as Korean or Chinese.

# Values

<span class="parameter">$autoFontGroupSize</span>

**Values**

* `1`: individual words are analysed
* `2`: words are analysed to see if they are distinctive of a particular language, and then surrounding text that is
  compatible is grouped together with these words
* `3`: as big chunks as possible are grouped, including ASCII characters and punctuation

Default: `2`
