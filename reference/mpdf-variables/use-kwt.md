mPDF >= 2.0

Keep with table

Default: `false`

If `true`: function `AdjustHTML()` adds an attribute KEEP-WITH-TABLE to any `<table>` which is immediately preceded 
by a `<h1-6>` element.

This attempts to keep the heading and table together on one page.

Can be used together with `<table style="page-break-inside: avoid;">`

Automatically sets the table to fit on one page (i.e. `page-break-inside:avoid`) if it is a rotated table.

Ignored if: 
* Heading is longer than one line of text on the page, 
* Columns are on, 
* Keep-block-together active (i.e. `page-break-inside:avoid` for surrounding BLOCK).
