<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
	**Note:** This variable originally started with an uppercase
	letter (<= mPDF 2.2). Support for the uppercase version was removed in mPDF >= 6.0
</div>

Set this variable to <span class="smallblock">TRUE</span> and columns will be written successively i.e. there will
be no balancing of the length of columns.

```php
<?php

$mpdf->keepColumns = true;

```
