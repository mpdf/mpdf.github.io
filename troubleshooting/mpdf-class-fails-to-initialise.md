(mPDF < 6.1)

mPDF still retains use of a constructor function with the same name as the class i.e.

```php
class mPDF {

function mPDF(...)

```

This means it is still compatible with PHP4, and is backwards compatible using PHP5 - 
**UNLESS** you are using namespaces in PHP >= 5.3

In this case you will need to upgrade at least to mPDF 6.1
