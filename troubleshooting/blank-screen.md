If you get nothing but a blank screen on your browser, it may be because there is a script error. 
Turn on debugging at the start of your script:

```php
<?php

// Require composer autoload
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

try {

	$mpdf = new \Mpdf\Mpdf();

	$mpdf->debug = true;

	$mpdf->WriteHTML("Hello World");

	$mpdf->Output();

} catch (\Mpdf\MpdfException $e) { // Note: safer fully qualified exception name used for catch
	// Process the exception, log, print etc.
	echo $e->getMessage();
}


```

## localhost problems / Vista 64 bit

Since updating to Windows Vistax64bit for development, all files containing images or 
external stylesheets crashed or timeout.

See the useful thread at http://www.wampserver.com/phorum/read.php?2,28291

To generate images and retrieve external stylesheets, mPDF needs to access files using fopen() etc. Changing 
"localhost" to "127.0.0.1" resolved the problem.

## Generating graphs with JPGraph

JPGraph outputs error messages as images generated by the script. If the error message is "out of memory" 
then you just get a blank screen. Try increasing your memory_limit.
